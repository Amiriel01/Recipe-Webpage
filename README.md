Objective:

Recipes Website:

I am creating a basic recipe website from The Odin Project curriculum. The website uses html skills that I am learning and introduces some css elements. This is my first attempt at building a webpage. The webpage was built using some directions from webpage and utilizing resources I found using internet searches. The links to the recipes work and take you to a new page for each recipe.

Finished Webpage Images:
