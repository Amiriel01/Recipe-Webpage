# Recipe Website

**Objective**

***Recipes Website Information***

I created a basic recipe website from The Odin Project curriculum. The website uses HTML skills that I am learning and introduces some CSS elements. This is my first attempt at building a webpage. This webpage was built using directions from The Odin Project and other resources I located while working on the project. The links to the recipes work and take you to a new page for each recipe.
